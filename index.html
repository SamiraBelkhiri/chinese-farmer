<h3>The Story </h3>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer
        whose horse ran away. That evening,
        all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
        They said,
        <q class="neighbors">
        “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
            This is most unfortunate.” </q>

        The farmer said,

        <q class="farmer"> <em>“Maybe.”</em></q>

        The next day the horse came back bringing
        seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and
        said,
        <q class="neighbors"> “Oh, isn’t that lucky.
        What a great turn of events.
            You now have eight horses!”</q>

        The farmer again said,

        <q class="farmer"><em> “Maybe.”</em></q>

        The following day his son tried to break
        one of the horses, and while riding it,
        he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said,

        <q class="neighbors">“Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,
            ” </q>
        and the farmer responded,
        <q class="farmer"><em>“Maybe.”</em></q>

        The next day the conscription officers
        came around to conscript people into the army,
        and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
        Again all the neighbors came around and said,

       <q class="neighbors"> “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said,
           <em>“Maybe.”</em></q>
        </p>

        <blockquote> The whole process of nature is an
    integrated process of immense complexity,
    and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything
    that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> —
    because you never know what will be the consequence
    of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
    consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<mark class="good">good</mark> and <mark class="bad">bad</mark> are just one perspective.
Bananas are <mark class="good">good</mark> for monkeys,
but monkeys are not <mark class="good">good</mark> for bananas.
Let's not make a big deal out of it...
